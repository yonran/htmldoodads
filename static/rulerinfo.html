<h1>More information</h1>
<p>I made this ruler because I was at a caf&#233; a couple days ago
(2011-02-19) and needed a ruler to measure some wire, but I couldn&#x2019;t
find a good one online.

<p>The ruler relies on the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, so it probably
doesn&#x2019;t work on IE. Life is too short to worry about IE
(and also I don&#x2019;t have a copy of newer IE on Ubuntu). If you can&#x2019;t
view the ruler and you&#x2019;re using IE, I don&#x2019;t want to hear about it
(unless you have a patch yourself).

<p>The source is already there (View Source), but I&#x2019;ll put revision
history at <a href="https://github.com/yonran/htmldoodads">github</a>.

<p>For feedback, you can email me at yonathan@gmail.com, or send me a tweet
@yonran.
