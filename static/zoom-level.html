<h1>Calculating zoom using Javascript</h1>

<p>2011-02-22 (updated 2012-05-24)
<p>Reading through the responses to the question:
&#x201C;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1713771/how-to-detect-page-zoom-level-in-all-modern-browsers"
>How to detect page zoom level in all modern browsers?</a>&#x201D;, I made
a <a href="https://github.com/yonran/detect-zoom">script to detect zoom on
GitHub</a>.

<p>Also, here's a <a href=dimensions.html>dimensions test page</a> to try in
multiple browsers and zoom levels.

<h2>Units</h2>
Here&#x2019;s my summary of
<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html">A
pixel is not a pixel is not a pixel</a> on Quirksmode.
<ul>
<li>CSS pixels are the unit of all CSS values and any element&#x2019;s
<code>clientX</code>, <code>offsetX</code>, etc. When you zoom in, there are
fewer CSS pixels available so CSS widths shrink.

<li>Device pixels are the physical pixels that the browser draws to. Usually,
each pixel owns three subpixels (red, green, and blue). But beware if your
device is a PenTile display, in which case each pixel has to share a subpixel
with a  neighboring pixel.

<li>Screen (system) pixels are the unit of all the properties that refer to the
screen: <code>screen.width</code>, <code>window.screenX</code>,
<code>window.outerWidth</code>, <code>event.screenX</code>. Older browsers
returned these measurements in device pixels, which don&#x2019;t change with
zoom. Firefox 4 begain reporting these in CSS pixels according to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#css-pixels">spec</a>.
And then there&#x2019;s WebKit (Nexus One and iPhone) and IE8,
which take this in a crazy bizarre level, where device vendors report
whatever they want for <code>screen.width</code>, and then developers have
to convert screen pixels to device pixels using a ratio stored somewhere.
So now there are three types of pixel we have to deal with.
</ul>

<h2>Important dimensions from
<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports.html">A tale of two viewports</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>&#x201C;Layout viewport&#x201D; width:
The width inside the window, not including scrollbars.
When something is <code>width: 100%</code> within the body, how wide will it be?
(Formally, the width of block elements within the root block formatting context.)
<li>&#x201C;Visual viewport&#x201D; width: when an iPhone zooms in, how big
is the viewport that can be seen? On mobile browsers, this is different from
the layout viewport because mobile browsers don&#x2019;t re-flow the page when
you zoom.
<li>&#x201C;Document&#x201D; width: the width of the document. When the
document overflows outside the viewport, this should include the off-screen
parts of the document too.
</ul>
